# Guru99-Bank-Project

## Project: Comprehensive Test Cycle Documentation 

### Project Overview:
This project is focused on developing and documenting the entire test cycle  of a Banking website using tools such as Google Sheets, JIRA, and Zephyr Scale. 
The primary objective is to create a robust and detailed framework for testing, ensuring all aspects of the software are thoroughly evaluated and documented.

## Key Features
* Test Scenarios:<br/>
 Detailed scenarios covering various aspects of the application to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
  
* Test Cases:<br/>
 Well-defined test cases incorporate techniques like boundary-value analysis (BVA) to handle edge cases and validate the application's robustness.

* User Stories:<br/>
 Clear and concise user stories capture the end-user's and stakeholders' requirements and expectations.
  
* Acceptance Criteria:<br/>
 Acceptance criteria are written using Gherkin syntax for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).
